these devtools are useful for working with TypeScript SuiteScript 2.0 projects using "@hitc/netsuite-types2" 

 * they are (should be) an independent project and should be useful on any  TypeScript SuiteScript 2.0 project, not only this one
 * support file watching - compile upload
 * support easy netsuite authentication and remembers it
 * support easy file upload on file changes
 * support automatic folder structure creation
 * support file uploading in a queue (configurable) so netsuite wont fail on multiple file uploads using SuiteTalk
 * supports local file hashing so it only downloads those files that changed
 * have little dependencies
