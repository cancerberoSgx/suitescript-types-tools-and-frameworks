      For example, Role A is set up to access only items associated with Location One. Therefore, employees who have Role A can access only items associated with Location One.

      Note: If the Multi-Location Inventory feature is not enabled, you cannot use this field to track inventory by locations. For example, you cannot track how many widgets you have in stock in Location One.

    * If the Multi-Location Inventory feature is enabled:

      Selecting an item record location classifies the item by that location to limit the items that certain roles can access. To track inventory per location, use the Locations subtab at the bottom of this form.
